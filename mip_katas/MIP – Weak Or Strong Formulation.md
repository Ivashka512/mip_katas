You have to prove that all feasible fractional solutions to blue must also be feasible to red.<br/>That shows that blue is in red but then you've also got to show that there exists a fractional solution thread that is not visible to blue.<br/>So that there's a point in red that is not in blue and if you can do that, then you've proven that blue is stronger than red.                                                              | Как отличить слабое решение от сильного                                       |

| Can we detect weak formulation, if the solution deviates when we turn off pre-solve?                           | If he's talking about the LP relaxation solution changes dramatic.<br/>If it degrades when you turn off pre-solve that is a sign that the initial formulation had weakness, but on the other hand there is at least some indication that Gurobi sort of did some pre-processing that strengthened it.<br/>You still need to look at what happens after pre-solving the rest of the optimization begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                               |

| Can pre-solve aggregate rows in an attempt to make the model smaller and inadvertently weaken the model again? | That's a good example, because pre-solve does try to reduce the number of constraints in rows but at the same time I don't think we'd ever try to make it weaker.<br/>Because the problem is when you aggregate rows if you remove the original rows, you actually are changing the model and admitting solutions that are not feasible now.<br/>What we will do is aggregate constraints to try to recognize something that enables us to tighten it.<br/>This is actually the foundation of mixed integer rounding cuts, but I think at some level we do that in pre-solve.<br/>But there again we never throw out the original constraints that we aggregated, so there's no danger of ever weakening the model. |
